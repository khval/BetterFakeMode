# BetterFakeMode
Make small patch to replace not so nice-looking fake modes in AmigaOS4.

This is early days of project, the only thing we do safely 
is to monitor the activities, from programs trying to open screens.

(We also use it simulate failure, that can be useful, to find unsuspected bugs in programs.)

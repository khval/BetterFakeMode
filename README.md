# BetterFakeMode
Make small patch to replace not so nice-looking fake modes in AmigaOS4.
The things it should solve.

# The problems, I like to solve.

* Aspect ratio is often wrong, itâ€™s not stretched / scaled correct.

* Many games and programs only work with 40 or 80 bytes per row,
and will not work with anything else. (Providing the correct size for video mode's
will allow old programs and games to be displayed correct.)

* Noticed problems with double buffered screens.

# Current status.

This is early days for the project, the only thing we do safely 
is to monitor the activities, from programs trying to open screens.

(We also use it simulate failure, that can be useful, to find unsuspected bugs in programs.)
